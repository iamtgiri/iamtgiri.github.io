# iamtgiri.github.io

This repository hosts my **personal website** via GitHub Pages.

The site serves as a central place for:
- A brief overview of my background
- Selected projects
- Links to my GitHub and professional profiles

Live site: https://iamtgiri.github.io

The implementation details of the website are intentionally kept simple.
