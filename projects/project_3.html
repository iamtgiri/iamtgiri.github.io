        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>Turtle Race</strong> is an engaging and interactive desktop application built using Python's <strong>Turtle graphics library</strong>. This fun game combines elements of chance and strategy, allowing users to bet on turtles racing to a finish line. The application also incorporates user authentication, enabling both new and returning users to manage their profiles and track their points.
        </p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>User Authentication:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>New users can create a username and password, with their details and starting points recorded in a CSV file (<code>usersdata.csv</code>).</li>
              <li>Returning users can log in with their existing credentials, retrieving their saved points.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

              <li>Full-screen mode for an immersive gaming experience.</li>
              <li>Colorful and dynamic graphics created using the Turtle graphics library.</li>
              <li>Text inputs for user interaction and bet placement.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gameplay:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Four colorful turtles (blue, pink, yellow, and red) race on a defined track.</li>
              <li>Users place bets on which turtle they think will win the race.</li>
              <li>Turtles move randomly across the screen, adding excitement and unpredictability to each race.</li>
              <li>The game declares a winner based on which turtle crosses the finish line first.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scoring System:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Points are awarded or deducted based on the outcome of the race and the user's bet.</li>
              <li>Scores are updated in real-time and saved to the user's profile for future sessions.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Visual and Sound Effects:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Eye-catching animations as turtles race and celebrate victory.</li>
              <li>Visual feedback on successful login, betting results, and end-of-game messages.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <ul>

            <strong>Languages and Libraries:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Python</strong> for the core logic.</li>
              <li><strong>Turtle</strong> for graphics and animations.</li>
              <li><strong>Pandas</strong> and <strong>CSV</strong> for user data management.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CSV Data File (<code>usersdata.csv</code>):</strong>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>User Authentication:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>On launch, users are asked if they are new or returning.</li>
              <li>New users register with a username and password, starting with 5000 points.</li>
              <li>Returning users log in, with their details verified against the CSV file.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gameplay Setup:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Users are welcomed with a custom message and current score displayed.</li>
              <li>The game screen transitions to the racetrack, setting up the turtles and the finish line.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Betting:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Users choose a turtle to bet on (options 1-4).</li>
              <li>Users enter the amount of points they wish to bet, ensuring it does not exceed their current points.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Race:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Turtles race with random movements towards the finish line.</li>
              <li>The race continues until one turtle crosses the finish line, determining the winner.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Results:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>If the user's chosen turtle wins, they gain points equivalent to their bet.</li>
              <li>If another turtle wins, the user loses the bet amount from their score.</li>
              <li>Updated points are saved to the CSV file.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Repeat or Exit:</strong>

              <li>Users are given the option to play again or exit.</li>
              <li>On exiting, a thank-you message is displayed.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <ul>
